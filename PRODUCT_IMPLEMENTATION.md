# Product Management Implementation

This document outlines the complete product management functionality implemented for the HaloHunt application.

## Backend Implementation

### 1. Product Controller (`server/controller/productController.js`)

The product controller provides comprehensive CRUD operations for products:

- **Create Product**: `POST /api/v1/products` - Create new products (Seller only)
- **Get My Products**: `GET /api/v1/products/my-products` - Get seller's products
- **Get Public Products**: `GET /api/v1/products` - Get approved, public products
- **Get Single Product**: `GET /api/v1/products/:id` - Get product details
- **Update Product**: `PUT /api/v1/products/:id` - Update product (Owner only)
- **Delete Product**: `DELETE /api/v1/products/:id` - Delete product (Owner only)
- **Image Management**: Add, remove, and set primary images
- **Stock Management**: Update product stock quantities
- **Search & Filter**: Search products with various filters
- **Categories**: Get product categories and featured products

### 2. Product Routes (`server/routes/productRoutes.js`)

Routes are organized with proper authentication middleware:
- Public routes for viewing products
- Protected routes for sellers to manage their products
- Image management endpoints

### 3. Media Controller Extensions

Extended the media controller to handle product images:
- `GET /api/v1/media/product-image-upload-url` - Generate S3 upload URLs
- `DELETE /api/v1/media/product-image` - Delete orphaned product images

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Product Service (`halohunt_web/src/app/services/productService.js`)

Frontend service layer that handles all product API calls:
- CRUD operations for products
- Image management
- Search and filtering
- Error handling and authentication

### 2. Media Service Extensions

Extended media service to handle product image uploads:
- S3 presigned URL generation for product images
- File upload to S3
- Image deletion

### 3. Product Modal Component (`halohunt_web/src/app/components/ProductModal.js`)

Comprehensive modal for adding/editing products:
- Form validation
- Multiple image upload with S3 integration
- Image management (primary, reorder, delete)
- Specifications and variants management
- Tags and metadata
- Status management

### 4. Profile Page Integration

Updated profile page to include:
- Real-time product data from API
- Product creation, editing, and deletion
- Image management
- Success notifications
- Loading states

## Key Features

### Image Management
- **Multiple Images**: Products can have multiple images
- **Primary Image**: First image automatically becomes primary
- **S3 Integration**: Images stored in AWS S3 with proper cleanup
- **Smart Deletion**: Images automatically deleted when products are deleted
- **Reordering**: Drag and drop image reordering (UI ready)

### Product Specifications
- **Dynamic Fields**: Add/remove specification pairs
- **Flexible Structure**: Name-value pairs for any product attributes

### Product Variants
- **Size/Color Support**: Flexible variant system
- **Individual Pricing**: Each variant can have different prices
- **Stock Tracking**: Individual stock levels per variant

### Security & Access Control
- **Owner-Only Access**: Only product owners can edit/delete
- **Seller Verification**: Only verified sellers can create products
- **Authentication Required**: All management operations require login

### Data Validation
- **Frontend Validation**: Real-time form validation
- **Backend Validation**: Server-side validation with proper error handling
- **Image Validation**: File type and size validation

## Database Schema

The product model includes:
- Basic product information (name, description, price)
- Image management (multiple images with primary selection)
- Inventory management (stock, variants)
- SEO fields (meta title, description, slug)
- Shipping information
- Product status and approval workflow

## S3 Integration

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Images deleted when products are deleted
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure upload process
- **Folder Organization**: Products stored in dedicated S3 folder
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if S3 operations fail

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Product
```javascript
const productData = {
  name: "Modern Desk Lamp",
  description: "Elegant desk lamp with adjustable brightness",
  price: 59.99,
  category: "Home & Garden",
  stockQuantity: 50,
  images: [], // Will be populated after S3 upload
  tags: ["lamp", "desk", "modern"]
};

const result = await productService.createProduct(productData);
```

### Adding Images
```javascript
// Get presigned URL
const uploadData = await mediaService.getProductImageUploadUrl(file.type);

// Upload to S3
await mediaService.uploadFileToS3(uploadData.uploadUrl, file);

// Add to product
await productService.addProductImage(productId, {
  url: uploadData.fileUrl,
  key: uploadData.key,
  alt: file.name,
  isPrimary: true
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export products
2. **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch integration
3. **Inventory Alerts**: Low stock notifications
4. **Product Analytics**: Views, favorites, conversion tracking
5. **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization
6. **Advanced Variants**: Complex variant combinations
7. **Product Reviews**: Rating and review system

## Testing

The implementation includes:
- Error handling for all operations
- Loading states and user feedback
- Form validation
- Image upload progress indicators
- Success/error notifications

## Security Considerations

- Authentication required for all management operations
- Owner-only access to product modifications
- S3 presigned URLs for secure file uploads
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper error handling without information leakage
